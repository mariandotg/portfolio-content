We expose a built-in component for appending elements to the `head` of the page:

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head';

function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>My page title</title>
      </Head>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default IndexPage;
```

To avoid duplicate tags in your `head` you can use the `key` property, which will make sure the tag is only rendered once, as in the following example:

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head';

function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>My page title</title>
        <meta property='og:title' content='My page title' key='title' />
      </Head>
      <Head>
        <meta property='og:title' content='My new title' key='title' />
      </Head>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default IndexPage;
```

In this case only the second `<meta property="og:title" />` is rendered. `meta` tags with duplicate `key` attributes are automatically handled.

> The contents of `head` get cleared upon unmounting the component, so make sure each page completely defines what it needs in `head`, without making assumptions about what other pages added.

`title`, `meta` or any other elements (e.g. `script`) need to be contained as **direct** children of the `Head` element,
or wrapped into maximum one level of `<React.Fragment>` or arraysâ€”otherwise the tags won't be correctly picked up on client-side navigations.

> We recommend using [next/script](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts) in your component instead of manually creating a `<script>` in `next/head`.
