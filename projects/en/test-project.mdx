# Test project ENGLISH VERSION

With this markup you can obtain *simple emhpasis* (usually rendered in italic text), **strong emphasis** (usually rendered in bold text), `source code` text (usually rendered in monospaced text), or ~~strikethrough~~ text (usually rendered with a line through text).

You may use also _this_ or __this__ notation to emphatize text, and you can use all them _**`together`**_ (and you can mix `*` and `_` )

If you look at the source code you may note that
even 
if 
you 
break 
the 
lines,
the text is kept together
in a single paragraph

 Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines, leading and trailing spaces are removed 

You may force a line break with two spaces  
or with a `\`\
at the end of the line
